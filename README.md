# Probabilistic-Inspired Analysis of Language Model Dynamics

## Overview

Modern AI language models, particularly those based on transformer architectures like **bert-base-uncased** and **roberta-base**, process text in remarkably complex and often opaque ways. This project takes inspiration from concepts in probabilistic mechanics (specifically, wave function collapse and quantum entanglement) to develop a novel framework for analyzing and interpreting their internal dynamics.

We introduce a structured, multi-layered linguistic perturbation system, combining classical NLP techniques, transformer models, fast nearest-neighbor search, and semantic filtering. Our approach treats the model's internal state as a "probability field" of potential meanings, which "collapses" into a concrete output upon processing an input. This allows us to explore meaning construction and robustness to input variations.

## Key Goals

* **Interpretability:** Understand how language models resolve ambiguity, incorporate context, and arrive at interpretations.
* **Robustness:** Systematically identify vulnerabilities and assess reliability to subtle but semantically meaningful input variations.
* **Bias Mitigation:** Detect and quantify hidden biases, facilitating fairer and more equitable AI systems.
* **Innovation:** Develop novel analytical tools inspired by probabilistic principles.
* **Semantic Shift Quantification:** Precisely quantify the degree of semantic shift induced by perturbations.

## Why It Matters

Understanding AI language models is crucial for:

* **Trust:** Building trust requires transparency and explainability.
* **Safety:** Identifying and mitigating failure modes is essential for real-world deployment.
* **Ethical Deployment:** Ensuring fairness and preventing unintended biases are paramount.
* **Advancement of AI:** Insights can inform the design of future, more robust and interpretable models.

This project bridges theoretical concepts (probabilistic mechanics) and practical engineering (NLP and machine learning) to create a more transparent, reliable, and ethically sound AI.

## Methodology: A Layered Approach

Our analysis proceeds in carefully designed phases:

### Phase 1: Controlled Linguistic Perturbations

* **Objective:** Generate systematically altered input sentences, where changes are controlled and meaningful, while maintaining grammatical correctness and coherence.
* **Method:**
  * **Semantic Similarity Tools:** Use pre-trained word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) and contextualized embeddings (BERT, RoBERTa) for semantically similar replacements.
  * **Syntactic Parsing:** Use dependency parsing (SpaCy) to ensure replacements maintain grammatical roles.
  * **Fast Nearest-Neighbor Search:** Use libraries like FAISS for efficient searching within large embedding spaces.
  * **Semantic Filtering:** Apply filtering with Sentence-BERT to ensure overall meaning preservation.
* **Example:**
  * Original: "The doctor diagnosed the patient."
  * Perturbed (semantic replacement): "The *nurse* diagnosed the patient."
  * Perturbed (syntactic variation, *incorrect*): "The doctor *prescribed* the patient." (different role)
  * Perturbed (semantically distant, *incorrect*): "The *car* diagnosed the patient." (low similarity)

### Phase 2: Measurement and Analysis of Model Response

* **Objective:** Quantify the impact of perturbations on the model's internal representations and output.
* **Methods:**
  * **Attention Shifts:** Analyze how attention weights within the transformer (e.g., **bert-base-uncased**, **roberta-base**) change across layers. For instance, does replacing "doctor" with "nurse" shift attention from "stethoscope" to "hospital"?
  * **Output Divergence:** Measure change in output probabilities:
    * **KL Divergence:** Difference between probability distributions of original and perturbed inputs. Calculated by comparing the log probabilities assigned by the model to each token in the vocabulary for both the original and perturbed inputs.
    * **Jensen-Shannon Divergence:** Symmetrized and smoothed KL divergence.
    * **Perplexity:** How "surprised" the model is by the perturbed input.
  * **Semantic Similarity of Outputs:** Compare output meaning (generated text) for original and perturbed inputs using Sentence-BERT and human evaluation (see Human Evaluation Protocol below).

### Phase 3: Probabilistic Analogies and Interpretations

* **Objective:** Explore analogies between model behavior and probabilistic mechanics.
* **Concepts:**
  * **Wave Function Collapse:** Larger perturbations lead to larger output shifts, analogous to measurement collapsing a wave function. The original input is a superposition of meanings; perturbation acts as a "measurement."
  * **Entanglement:** Investigate non-local dependencies. Changing "bank" might affect attention to both "loan" and "river."
* **Analysis:** Correlate perturbation magnitude (embedding distance) with output divergence (KL divergence, etc.).

### Phase 4: Practical Applications and Validation

* **Objective:** Apply the framework to address real-world challenges.
* **Applications:**
  * **Bias Audits:** Systematically perturb sentences to uncover biases. Change "CEO" to "receptionist" and measure output differences related to gender, race, etc.
  * **Robustness Testing:** Identify linguistic vulnerabilities. Test sensitivity to adversarial examples.
  * **Adversarial Example Generation:** Create targeted examples to test model defenses.
  * **Model Improvement:** Use insights to fine-tune or retrain models.

        pass
        
    def run_experiment(self):
        # Iterate, generate perturbations, measure, store results.
        pass
```

### Key Experiment Dimensions

* **Instructions:** Annotators will be presented with pairs of sentences (original and perturbed) and asked to rate the semantic similarity on a Likert scale (e.g., 1-5, where 1 is "completely different" and 5 is "identical in meaning"). They will also be asked to flag any perturbations that result in ungrammatical or nonsensical sentences.
* **Inter-Annotator Agreement:** Calculate inter-annotator agreement using metrics like Cohen's Kappa or Fleiss' Kappa to ensure consistency in the human evaluations.
